# Assignment 7 - Pokemon Trainer

This assignment was to make a Pokémon trainer web app using the Angular Framework.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.


The application allows the user to log in, catch Pokémon and view their caught Pokémon on their trainer-page.


## Background

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
